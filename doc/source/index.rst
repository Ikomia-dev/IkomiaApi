Welcome to Ikomia's documentation
=================================

:Current version: |version|

The Ikomia platform is made up of three components:

    - **Ikomia Marketplace**: centralized place where you can find plug'n'play algorithms of Computer Vision
    - **Ikomia Studio**: free desktop software (Linux and Windows) for easy algorithm evaluation and fast prototyping
    - **Ikomia API**: Python API to leverage state of the art algorithms for your own computer vision application and/or create plugins for Ikomia Studio and the Marketplace

.. note:: Ikomia API is built around Ikomia Core, a set of C++ libraries with Python bindings.

.. important:: Ikomia Studio and Ikomia API are Open-Source projects, distributed under AGPLv3 and Apache 2.0 respectively.


Choose your API usage
---------------------
As an Ikomia user, you will be led to use this API for two reasons:

    - **Create plugins for Ikomia platform**: with a little wrap around your Python code, you are able to give access to your algorithm from a user friendly software (Ikomia Studio) and a flexible workflow API. Moreover, from Ikomia Studio you can publish your work to the Marketplace in one click and share it with the community.
    - **Use Ikomia algorithms and workflows in your custom applications**: leverage built-in algorithms and those from the Marketplace directly in your application. Run single algorithm or workflows with few lines of code.
